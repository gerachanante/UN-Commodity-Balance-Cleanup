The script processes UN energy statistics data, specifically the commodity balance, and transforms it into a cleaned, enriched, energy-converted intermediate dataset ready for further analysis

## 1. Helper Functions

Two small utilities are defined upfront:

- **`read_excel_table`** reads a named Excel table (a defined region, not just a sheet) into a `data.table`.
- **`first_non_blank`** takes a vector and returns the first non-empty, non-NA string value. This is used later to safely collapse duplicate lookup rows without inventing data.

## 2. Loading Data

Six source files are loaded:

| Object            | File                      | Content                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `rules`           | UN.Energy data codes.xlsx | Transformation rules (commodity/transaction recoding) |
| `prod_cleanup`    | IRENA.Codes.xlsx          | Messy-to-clean product name mapping                   |
| `products`        | IRENA.Codes.xlsx          | Product metadata and NCV defaults                     |
| `transactions`    | UN.Energy data codes.xlsx | Transaction metadata (sign, DNI flags, categories)    |
| `country_cleanup` | Countries.xlsx            | Country name to ISO3 mapping                          |
| `UN_NCV`          | UN.NCV.xlsx               | Country-year-product Net Calorific Values             |
| `balance`         | UN.Commodity balance.csv  | The main raw energy statistics dataset                |

## 3. Type Stabilization

All columns across all tables are explicitly cast to the correct types (character, numeric, integer). This prevents silent type mismatches during joins and computations, a common source of bugs with mixed-source data.

---

## 4. Deduplication of Lookups

Each lookup table is collapsed so there is exactly one row per key, using `first_non_blank` to pick the first valid value. This ensures joins are clean 1-to-many (not many-to-many), avoiding row explosion and ensuring no fabricated values sneak in.

## 5. Cleaning the Balance Table

Several fixes are applied to the raw commodity balance:

- **Zero rows dropped** — observations with `OBS_VALUE == 0` are removed since they carry no information.
- **Unit normalization** — `TN` → `kt`, `M3` → `kM3` for consistency.
- **Commodity fixes** — three specific overrides:
    - Transactions 162/1621/1622 get commodity `2000` 
    - Commodity `7000N` → `9101` to move electricity from nuclear to the nuclear column
    - Two transaction codes are rewritten (`0889H` → `015HP`, `0889E` → `015EB`), allocating electric boilers and heat pumps
- **Production recoding** — if a product has a specific `UNSD production recoding` or `UNSD receipts recoding`, those override the raw transaction code. This handles cases where UN classifies something as production (`01`) or receipts (`022`) but it should be mapped to a more specific transaction.
- **DNI filtering** — rows marked "Do Not Include" for production are dropped after recoding.

## 6. Enriching with Metadata

A series of left joins attach metadata to each balance row:

- **Product info** — product name, source type (primary/secondary), default NCV, production/receipts recoding rules
- **Transaction info** — transaction name and description, merge category, whether it's a combustible plant flow, NCV type, sign (positive/negative), DNI flag
- **Country ISO3** — standardises country identifiers
- **Country-specific NCVs** — from `UN_NCV`, matched by a composite key of `ISO3 + Year + ProdCode + NCV type`

## 7. NCV Selection and Energy Calculation

The script builds a priority hierarchy for selecting the Net Calorific Value to use:

1. **Hardcoded overrides** for specific edge cases (electricity in GWh, heat pumps/electric boilers, a specific biofuel product code)
2. **UN-provided conversion factor** from the balance itself
3. **Country-specific NCV** from the UN_NCV table
4. **Generic/default NCV** from the products table
5. **NONE** — no NCV available

Energy is then computed as `TJ = NCV × OBS_VALUE`, and `NCV_SOURCE` records which source was used for auditability. PJ variants and a comparison column `TJ diff` (vs. UN's own conversion) are also calculated.

## 8. Transformation Rules

This is the most complex step. A set of rules defines how certain commodity+transaction combinations should be **converted into a different commodity+transaction**, with a multiplier applied to the energy values. This replicates a Power Query-style transformation logic.

For each matching row in the balance, a new row is generated representing the transformed commodity (e.g., converting fuel inputs to electricity outputs). The new rows get:

- Updated `COMMODITY` and `TRANSACTION` codes
- Re-joined transaction metadata
- Re-mapped `ProdCode` via `prod_cleanup`
- Product label set from the rule's `cto` column (the target label)
- Energy values scaled by the rule `Multiplier`

## 9. Stacking and Final Cleanup

The original balance rows (labeled `"Original"`) and the transformation-derived rows (labeled `"Added"`) are stacked into a single table called `UN_energy_stats_intermediate`.

One final label fix is applied: rows for "Heat from combustible fuels" and "Thermal electricity" are relabeled to simply "Heat" and "Electricity" for consistency.

## 10. RAS Splits

Three analytical subsets are carved out for a **RAS (Residual Allocation/Scaling) procedure**, to reconcile plant-level fuel inputs with electricity/heat outputs:

|Object|What it contains|
|---|---|
|`ras_plant_inputs`|Fuel inputs going _into_ combustible electricity/heat/CHP plants|
|`ras_plant_outputs`|Energy outputs _from_ those same plants (non-DNI rows)|
|`ras_fuel_outputs`|Electricity/heat outputs that _are_ DNI-flagged and positive — these are the "fuel-derived" output flows needing conversion|

## 11. Export

All four tables are written to CSV in a staging folder:

- `ras_fuel_outputs.csv`
- `ras_plant_inputs.csv`
- `ras_plant_outputs.csv`
- `UN_energy_stats_intermediate.csv` — the main output, used downstream
